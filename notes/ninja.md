# ninja

> build system with a focus on speed - differs from other build systems: designed to have its input files generated by higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible

## usage
```sh
# many of ninjaâ€™s flags intentionally match those of `make`

ninja -h                  # prints help

ninja -C DIR -j 20        # changes into DIR dir run 20 build commands in parallel
```
