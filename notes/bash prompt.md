# You can set this in your bash shell config to flip a table whenever a command fails with a non-zero exit status.
PROMPT_COMMAND='[ $? -eq 0 ] || printf "(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻\n"' 

prompt_command () {
  if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then # set an error string for the prompt, if applicable
    ERRPROMPT=" "
  else
    ERRPROMPT='->($?) '
