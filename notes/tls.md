> `SNI` stands for `Server Name Indication` and is an extension of the TLS protocol. It indicates which hostname is being contacted by the browser at the beginning of the 'handshake'-process.
> This allows a server to present multiple certificates on the same IP address and TCP port number and hence `allows multiple secure websites to be served off the same IP address` without requiring all those sites to use the same certificate.
