# meltdown spectre

- variant 1: `CVE-2017-5753` bounds-check bypass aka spectre 
- variant 2: `CVE-2017-5715` branch target injection aka spectre 
- variant 3: `CVE-2017-5754` rogue data cache load aka meltdown

-| Spectre | Meltdown 
-|-- |--
CPU mechanism for triggering    | Speculative execution from branch prediction                                  | Out-of-order execution
Affected platforms              | CPUs that perform speculative execution from branch prediction                | CPUs that allow memory reads in out-of-order instructions
Difficulty of successful attack | High - Requires tailoring to the software environment of the victim process   | Low - Kernel memory access exploit code is mostly universal
Impact                          | Cross- and intra-process (including kernel) memory disclosure                 | Kernel memory disclosure to userspace
Software mitigations            | Variant 1: Compiler changes. Web browser updates to help prevent exploitation from JavaScript; Variant 2: Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS). Note: The software mitigation for Spectre variant 2 requires CPU microcode updates	Kernel page-table isolation (KPTI)|Kernel page-table isolation `KPTI`
