# bash variables

## usage
```sh
varname=value                # defines a variable
varname=value command        # defines a variable to be in the environment of a particular subprocess
echo $varname                # checks a variable's value
echo $$                      # prints process ID of the current shell
echo $!                      # prints process ID of the most recently invoked background job
echo $?                      # displays the exit status of the last command
export VARNAME=value         # defines an environment variable (will be available in subprocesses)


${varname:-word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:=word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:?'message'}        # if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise print varname, followed by message and abort the current command or script
${varname:+word}             # if varname exists and isn't null, return word; otherwise return null
${varname:offset:length}     # performs substring expansion. It returns the substring of $varname starting at offset and up to length characters


${variable#pattern}          # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable##pattern}         # if the pattern matches the beginning of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%pattern}          # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the shortest part that matches and return the rest
${variable%%pattern}         # if the pattern matches the end of the variable's value, delete the longest part that matches and return the rest


${variable/pattern/string}   # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. Only the first match is replaced
${variable//pattern/string}  # the longest match to pattern in variable is replaced by string. All matches are replaced

${#varname}                  # returns the length of the value of the variable as a character string


*(patternlist)               # matches zero or more occurences of the given patterns
+(patternlist)               # matches one or more occurences of the given patterns
?(patternlist)               # matches zero or one occurence of the given patterns
@(patternlist)               # matches exactly one of the given patterns
!(patternlist)               # matches anything except one of the given patterns
```
