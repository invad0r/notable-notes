# baudot

> character encoding for telegraphy invented by Ã‰mile Baudot

- was the predecessor to the International Telegraph Alphabet No. 2 (`ITA2`)
- the most common teleprinter code in use until the advent of `ascii`
- each character in the alphabet is represented by a series of `5 bits`
- the symbol rate measurement is known as `baud`, and is derived from the same name
