# javac

> primary java compiler included in the `jdk` from oracle. Martin Odersky implemented the GJ compiler, and his implementation became the basis for javac[2]
> `javac` accepts source code conforming to the Java language specification (JLS) and produces Java bytecode conforming to the Java Virtual Machine Specification (JVMS).
> javac is itself written in Java. The compiler can also be invoked programmatically

```sh
javac -d . Foo.java   # -d specify directory for package
```
