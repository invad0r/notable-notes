# tcpdump

> dump traffic on a network 

## usage
```sh
tcpdump -i eth1                     # capture packets from a particular interface

tcpdump -i eth1 -vvv                # more verbose

tcpdump -i eth2 -t                  # no timestamp

tcpdump -i eth1 -n                  # display packets with IP address instead of DNS names

tcpdump -i eth1 -A                  # display in ASCII

tcpdump -i eth1 -XX                 # display Captured Packets in HEX and ASCII

tcpdump -i eth1 -c 10               # capture only N number of packets

tcpdump -i eth1 -w tmp.pcap         # capture the packets and write into a file

tcpdump -i eth1 -w tmp.pcap -s 0    # capture and store network frames full-length

tcpdump -tttt -r tmp.pcap           # reading the packets from a saved file

tcpdump -i eth1 -tttt               # capture packets with proper readable timestamp

tcpdump -i eth1 arp                 # To receive only the packets of a specific protocol type:
                                    #   fddi, tr, wlan, ip, ip6, arp, rarp, decnet, tcp and udp

tcpdump host 1.2.3.4                # show you traffic from 1.2.3.4, source or dest


tcpdump src 2.3.4.5                 # filter by source 
tcpdump dst 3.4.5.6                 # filter by destication
tcpdump net 1.2.3.0/24              # filter by network

tcpdump -i eth1 port 22
tcpdump -i eth1 src port 1026
tcpdump -i eth1 dst 10.181.140.216 and port 22

tcpdump -i eth1 less 32             # filter on packet size
tcpdump -i eth1 greater 64 
tcpdump -i eth1 <= 128


# -t        Don't print a timestamp on each dump line. 
# -tt       Print the timestamp, as seconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00, UTC, and fractions of a second since that time, on each dump line. 
# -ttt      Print a delta (microsecond or nanosecond resolution depending on the --time-stamp-precision option) between current and previous line on each dump line. The default is microsecond resolution. 
# -tttt     Print a timestamp, as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since midnight, preceded by the date, on each dump line. 
# -ttttt    Print a delta (microsecond or nanosecond resolution depending on the --time-stamp-precision option) between current and first line on each dump line. The default is microsecond resolution. 
# -l                                          see the traffic as it's capturing
# -A                                          print each packet (minus its link level header) in ASCII
# -s snaplen, --snapshot-length=snaplen       0 sets it to the default of 262144

# Find Cleartext Passwords
