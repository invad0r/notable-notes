! EXPRESSION      True if EXPRESSION is false; else false
EXPR1 && EXPR2    True if both EXPR1 and EXPR2 are true; else false
EXPR1 || EXPR2    True if either EXPR1 or EXPR2 is true; else false

OPERATORS
`==`, `!=`      string to the right of operator is used as pattern and pattern matching is performed
`=~`            string to the right of operator is matched as a regular expression
`&&`, `||`      do not evaluate EXPR2 if EXPR1 is sufficient to determine the expression's value
