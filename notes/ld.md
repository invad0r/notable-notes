# ld

> the GNU linker - ld combines object and archive files, relocates their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program

## usage
```sh
ld main.o -lc   # tell the linker to include `libc`

# produce a file OUTPUT as the result of linking `/lib/crt0.o` with `hello.o` and the library `libc.a`, which will come from the standard search directories.
ld -o OUTPUT /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
```
