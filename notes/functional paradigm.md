# functional paradigm

functional programming models computation as the evaluation of expressions

- programs execute by evaluate expressions
- funcions are first-class
  - functions are treated as values
  - functions are passed as arguments
  - function are returned as results
- HOF - Higher Order Functions (passed as arguments e.g. map Fn->List)
- Immutable Data
- Referential transparency (pure computation, yield same result each time invoked)
- lazy evaluation (avoid unnecessary computation)
- recursion
