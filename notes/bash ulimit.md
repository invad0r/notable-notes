# bash ulimit

> provides control over the resources available to the shell and processes it creates, on systems that allow such control

## usage
```sh
# options
#
# -S        use the `soft` resource limit
# -H        use the `hard` resource limit
#
# -a        all current limits are reported
# -b        socket buffer size
# -c        maximum size of core files created
# -d        maximum size of a process's data segment
# -e        maximum scheduling priority (`nice')
# -f        maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
# -i        maximum number of pending signals
# -l        maximum size a process may lock into memory
# -m        maximum resident set size
# -n        maximum number of open file descriptors
# -p        pipe buffer size
# -q        maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
# -r        maximum real-time scheduling priority
# -s        maximum stack size
# -t        maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
# -u        maximum number of user processes
# -v        size of virtual memory
# -x        maximum number of file locks


ulimit -a       # show all ulimits

ulimit -nH      # check hard limit for filedescriptors
ulimit -nS     # check soft limit for filedescriptors

ulimit -u       # max num of processes user can start
ulimit -uH      # hard limit of processes user can start
ulimit -uS      # soft limit of processes user can start

ulimit -c       # filesize for core-dumps; default=0

ulimit -l       # max locked memory (kbytes)
                #   memlock see docker-compose
                #   memlock:  locks sets of pages in memory => jvm-gc goes thorugh all pages of Heap !
                #   mlockall: lock all pages
```
