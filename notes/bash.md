# bash

> At its base, a shell is simply a `macro processor` that executes commands. The term `macro processor` means functionality where text and symbols are expanded to create larger expressions. 

## usage
```sh
bash -c "echo 1"   # -c read command-string

bash -i            # shell is interactive.

bash -l            # act as if it had been invoked as a login shell

bash -x            # dump what bash runs on startup http://superuser.com/a/144777


# variables
$0                      # current shell ?

$BASH

$BASH_VERSION           # As a string.

${BASH_VERSINFO[@]}     # As an array.

${FUNCNAME[@]}          # All functions including parents.
```
