# baud

> common measure of symbol rate, which is one of the components that determine the speed of communication over a data channel

- unit for symbol rate or modulation rate in symbols per second or pulses per second
- is the number of distinct symbol changes (signaling events) made to the transmission medium per second in a digitally modulated signal or a bd rate line code.
- `baud` is related to gross bit rate, which can be expressed in bits per second
-  If there are precisely two symbols in the system (`0`,`1`), then baud and bit per second `bit/s` are equivalent
