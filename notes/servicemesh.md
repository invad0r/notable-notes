# servicemesh

- fundamentaly an overlay network
- differs from `VXLAN` in that it operates at `layer 3` rather than `layer 2`
- `TLS` encrypted
- instead of shared `VTEP`'s there is an Envoy proxy instance per service endpoint

### implications
- all traffic in the mesh is encrypted by default
- traditional security technologies (layer 2 IDS/IPS) will not function as desired due to encryption
- servicemesh-endpoints can be placed anywhere that has `layer 3` connectivity with the other mesh endpoints (on premise, cloud, etc)
