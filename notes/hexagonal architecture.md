# hexagonal architecture

> architectural pattern used in software design - aims at creating loosely coupled application components that can be easily connected to their software environment by means of ports and adapters

> The idea of Hexagonal Architecture is to put inputs and outputs at the edges of our design. 
> Business logic should not depend on whether we expose a REST or a GraphQL API, 
> and it should not depend on where we get data from â€” a database, a microservice API exposed via gRPC or REST, or just a simple CSV file.
