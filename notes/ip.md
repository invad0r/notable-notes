# ip

> edits and displays the configuration of network interfaces, routing, and tunnels

## install
`apt install iproute2`, `yum install iproute`

## usage
```sh
ip [options] object {command|help}

# options
#  -s, -stats, -statistics       Output more information. -s -s => more verbose
#  -f, -family                   inet, inet6, bridge, ipx, dnet, link
#  -4                            shortcut for -family inet.
#  -6                            shortcut for -family inet6.
#  -B                            shortcut for -family bridge.
#  -0                            shortcut for -family link.
#  -o, -oneline                  output each record on a single line, replacing line feeds with the '\' character
