# bash pwd

> print the name of the current working directory

## usage
```sh
pwd -L     # print the value of $PWD if it names the current working directory

pwd -P     # print the physical directory, without any symbolic links


SCRIPTPATH="$( cd "$(dirname "$0")" ; pwd -P )"                   # script path

CURRENT_DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" && pwd )"   # if `cd` works return current working dir
```
