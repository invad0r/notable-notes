# c printf

```c
printf("format", args)            // is used to print the data onto the standard output which is often a computer monitor.

sprintf(char *, "format", args)   // stores the formated data in a string pointed to by the char pointer 

fprintf(FILE *fp, "format", args) // formated data is saved on a file which is pointed to by the file pointer
```
