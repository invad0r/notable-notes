nvm install 6.14.4 # or 10.10.0, 8.9.1, etc

nvm ls-remote # available versions


nvm use node

nvm run node --version

nvm exec 4.2 node --version    # run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node

nvm which 5.0                  # get the path to the executable to where it was installed:
