# unix socket

> allows communication between two different processes `IPC`
> on either the same machine or different machines in client-server application frameworks

- Every UNIX systems Input/Output action is executed by writing or reading the descriptor file
- Descriptor file is an open file, which is associated with an integer
  - It can be a network connection, text file, terminal or something else. 
  - It looks and behaves much like a low-level file descriptor. 
  - This happens because the commands like read () and write () works with the same way they do with the files and pipes.


### socket
- combination of IP-Address and Port-Number
- 2 types:
  - stream - reliable two-way connected communication streams
  - datagram
