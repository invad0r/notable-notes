# make

> `Makefile.am` is a programmer-defined file and is used by `automake` to generate the `Makefile.in` file 

- `.am` stands for `automake`
- `.in` input for `configure` think of template

## usage

```sh
make -f MyOtherMakefile     # specify other file

make clean                  # run specific target

make -B venv                # always run target
```

### target
```make
.PHONY : clean      #  telling Make that this is a phony target, that it does not build anything

clean :
	rm -f *.dat
```

```make
clean:
  @echo "Cleaning up..."    # suppress echoing the actual command place `@` before command
  rm *.txt
```

## variables
- `${CC}` and `$(CC)` are valid references to call `gcc`
- `:=` operator, also called the `simply expanded variable` to avoid infinite loops
```make
CC := gcc
CC := ${CC}

all:
    @echo ${CC}
```
