# nmap
> `network mapper`

## install
`brew install nmap`, `apt install nmap`, `yum install nmap`

## usage
```sh
# scanning options:
# -sR             if RPC-Service found send additional RPC-Pakets to find out more of services
# -sV             additional tests contains -sR; option enables version detection
# -O              OS-Destection
# -A              short for -sV -O
# -P0             before portscan nmap check via PING and TCP-PORT-80 scan if host is available
#                 used for hosts without webserver and block ping;  option allows you to switch off ICMP pings.
# -oN FILE        write scan to file
# -v              verbose

# port scanning methods
# -sT              Connect Scan: TCP-Connection per scanned port, no root required
# -sS              "SYN-Stealth-Scan" like -sT but without full TCP-Connection aka "half-open"/"stealth scanning"
# -sU              scan UDP-Port
# -sP              ping-scan

nmap localhost                    # list own open ports

nmap -p 2376 10.32.23.30          # check if port open

nmap -T5 -sP 10.32.22.0-255       # ping network for avail hosts

nmap -sn -PS80 10.32.22.250       # ping one node if ping not avail.

nmap -sS -P0 -sV -O TARGET        # Get info about remote host ports and OS detection

nmap -sS -P0 -A -v TARGET

nmap -sT -p 80 -oG – 192.168.1.* | grep open      # list of servers with a specific port open

nmap -sP 192.168.0.*                              # Find all active IP addresses in a network

nmap -sP 192.168.0.0/24                           # for specific  subnets

nmap -sP 192.168.1.100-254                        # Ping a range of IP addresses

nmap -T4 -sP 192.168.2.0/24 && egrep "00:00:00:00:00:00" /proc/net/arp    # Find unused IPs on a given subnet

nmap -sP 192.168.1.1/24   # scan network


# Scan Network for Rogue APs. host-timeout 20m –max-scan-delay 1000 -oA wapscan 10.0.0.0/8
nmap -A -p 1-85,113,443,8080-8100 -T4 –min-hostgroup 50 –max-rtt-timeout 2000 \
  –initial-rtt-timeout 300 –max-retries 3 – 


# Use a decoy while scanning ports to avoid getting caught by the sys admin 
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.0.10 -D 192.168.0.2     
# Scan for open ports on the target device/computer (192.168.0.10) while setting up a decoy address (192.168.0.2).
# This will show the decoy ip address instead of your ip in targets security logs. 
# Decoy address needs to be alive. Check the targets security log at /var/log/secure to make sure it worked.


# List of reverse DNS records for a subnet
nmap -R -sL 209.85.229.99/27 | awk '{if($3=="not")print"("$2") no PTR";else print$3" is "$2}' | grep '('
# This command uses nmap to perform reverse DNS lookups on a subnet. 
# It produces a list of IP addresses with the corresponding PTR record for a given subnet. 
# You can enter the subnet in CDIR notation (i.e. /24 for a Class C)). 
# You could add "–dns-servers x.x.x.x" after the "-sL" if you need the lookups to be performed on a specific DNS server. 
# On some installations nmap needs sudo I believe. Also I hope awk is standard on most distros.


# How Many Linux And Windows Devices Are On Your Network?
sudo nmap -F -O 192.168.0.1-255 | grep "Running: " > /tmp/os; \
echo "$(cat /tmp/os | grep Linux | wc -l) Linux device(s)"; \
echo "$(cat /tmp/os | grep Windows | wc -l) Window(s) devices"

nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers -p PORT HOST   # get availables ssl/tls versions
