# smalltalk

> fully object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language with no ‘non-object’ types

## usage
```smalltalk
result := myObject doSomethingWith: thatObject 
```
We are sending the message ‘doSomethingWith:’ to myObject. This happens to be a message that has a single argument but that’s not important yet. ‘myObject’ is a ‘MyExampleClass’ instance so the system looks at the list of messages understood by MyExampleClass
